#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Stage 1 of this project will demonstrate responsive design patterns, including, but not limited to, responsive images 
and CSS grid layout. Accessibility for screen readers will follow the WAI-ARIA specification. Finally, the website will 
be designed  to be offline first to provide a seamless offline experience for users.

### How to Run the Project

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

2. Check to see if you have Python installed. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 

   If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
   For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server`. 
   
   If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
